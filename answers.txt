Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: It is very useful for version control and maintaining code organization. It allows for management of code and reduces confusion, or the likelihood of you losing the version of code that you are working on. Moreover, it makes collaboration much easier because you can push and pull from a repo.
